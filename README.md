## Overview of Project
Robin an astronomy enthusiast has a creative plan to fufill her dreams to work for NASA.  With my help Robin will create a database using web scrapping to gather the latest news feature, with stunning images of the mysterious red planet "Mars". Beautiful Soup and Splinter will facilitate automating the scrape. Py-Mongo will be used to store all the amazing data. The collected  data will be displayed  on a web application using Flask.  This centralized display will facilitate viewing by other astronomy enthusiasts and also become a major part of Robin portfolio.

## Results
* Web app with interactive "Scrape New Data" button, this feature automatically searches for the latest news with images to display on the web app.(See Section "Scraping News")

* Mars Facts Table was created and CSS-Bootstrap was used to introduce a hover element to the table. That is when the mouse is pointed at a table row that row is hightlighted. The other "Bootstrap" element that was included was used was to make the "Scrape New Data" button stand out with a stunning green.   (See Section "Make It Pretty").
 
* Full resolution images of Mars Hemisphere and Titles were also added to the webapp 
* Mobile responsive: Bootstrap elements were also employed to ensure that the that the app could be viewed from any mobile device. The "Grid Template" was used in order to produce thumnail images that work with both full screen and mobile device viewing. (See Section "Mars Hemispheres")
